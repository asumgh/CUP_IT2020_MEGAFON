# CUP_IT_FINAL
Propose and implement a mathematical model that, based on previously accumulated statistics on station failure, will predict the duration of station disconnection from the network in a particular location within a given territory. And independently evaluate the quality of the proposed model.
Since data from the GPS module may be unstable, the model must determine the forecast for the duration of the outage at any point specified by latitude and longitude coordinates within the area.
